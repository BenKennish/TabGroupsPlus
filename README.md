# TabGroupsPlus

An extension for Chrome and Chromium-based web browsers (e.g. Brave) that adds functionality related to Tab Groups:

1. Auto-collapses any expanded tab groups that don't contain the active tab when...
    - the mouse cursor enters the content area of the active tab
    - a short time after a system tab is activated (e.g. browser settings, a blank tab, etc)
    - the active tab is moved to a different group

2. Aligns the auto-collapsed tabs to the left/right side of the tab bar (optional).

3. Auto-groups new tabs into the currently active tab's group (optional).

## Installation

If you've downloaded this from GitHub, extract the files into a folder somewhere and then in
your browser's "Extensions" section, enable Developer Mode, and the use Load Unpacked extension,
pointing it to the folder.
